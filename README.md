# MarkWrite
A tool for the inspection and segmentation of digitized writing data 
from pen tablet type devices.

# Status
The tool is currently in the initial development stage and is 
functionally incomplete. At this time MarkWrite would not be of much use to anyone 
but the project collaborators.
